# SmartWallet for Recurring Payments

SmartWallet serves as simplified smart contract wallet that allows users to set up automatic recurring payments, either as installments or continuous subscriptions, in a non-custodial fashion.

The SmartWallet Factory allows users to deploy a SmartWallet for themselves.

## Overview

This protocol is a modified version of a previous side project of mine that was shelved, but I was inspired to bring it back for Raid Guild to implement in their product, [smartinvoice.xyz](https://smartinvoice.xyz/).

The purpose of the SmartWallet contract is to allow clients and customers the ability to securely pay through installments or even pay for subscription services without the need of any 3rd-party intermediaries such as credit cards, payment processors, etc.

This can be modified to interact with the escrow contract already used by the smart invoice dapp or can serve as its own product that complements the escrow contract.

## Current Status

This protocol is still not finished and has not been thoroughly tested yet. If others are interested, testing will come soon.
